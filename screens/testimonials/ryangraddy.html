            Although I was not a recruited athlete at Brown, the presence of men’s cross country and track programs factored crucially into my decision to enroll – I was accepted as a PLME student and would not have attended without the
            opportunity to walk onto those teams. My 4 years of experience as a distance runner for Brown was the single most impactful part of my undergraduate time, and introduced me to a vastly more diverse group of people than I had grown
            up with to that point. Today my work as a primary care physician is deeply rooted in the shared experiences I had on the team that have inspired so many other of my teammates and friends to continue to work to make the world a
            better, safer, and more equitable place.
