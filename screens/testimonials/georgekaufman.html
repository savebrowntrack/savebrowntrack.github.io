            As a walk-on in '97, Brown Varsity Track & Field was inextricably linked to my undergraduate experience, mental and physical health, social structure, and academic success at Brown and beyond. I would not have applied to Brown in
            the first place if it did not have a varsity T&F/XC team. As a recipient of financial aid and as someone whose high school had few sports other than Track & Field and Cross Country--despite not having a track--I speak from
            experience that it is one of the most accessible and ubiquitous sports, and having a varsity team at Brown is essential for promoting racial and socioeconomic diversity as well as excellence in athletics.
