            To say this team ‘means a lot to me’ is an extreme understatement and misrepresentation of how absolutely vital my team, and teammates are to my college experience. I don’t consider myself a Brown University student. First and foremost I
            am an athlete on the track team at Brown. Being a track athlete here truly IS my identity, and I don’t know who I am or what I will do without it.
            <br></br>
            I could go on and on about how good we are, how sad I will be if the team is cut, and how much I wish they would reverse this. However, the reality is that the termination of this team is embarrassing for Brown as a whole. It has never
            been clearer that diversity is not important to the administration. The athletic department has systematically and purposefully found an extremely effective way to exclude low-income, POC from pursuing higher education. Whether this is
            intentional or not can be debated, however Brown has shown themselves to be extremely hypocritical of all the values they claim to uphold.
