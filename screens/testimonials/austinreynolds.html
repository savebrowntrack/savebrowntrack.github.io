            Brown university destroyed decades of history unilaterally and unfairly. The process by which Brown track and field was dismantled was an obscure and illegitimate process that used spurious measures to advance the administrations
            goals. It is my family’s and my intent to never contribute to Brown again since they cannot be trusted with our money.
            <br></br>
            President Paxson seems intent on reducing Brown to the profile of any other liberal arts school by taking away what makes it special. In other aspects Brown has reduced concentrations and rolled studies into other departments as
            well as cutting ties with Senior Fellows. This path is disappointing for the administration and bodes poorly for the University’s future as an elite institution.
