            As a recruited athlete from an under-performing public school district and a financial aid recipient, I know that my story is one of many which portray track and field as a sport defined by its accessibility. You can reach D1 with
            a pair of shoes and a work ethic. Getting recruited to run at an Ivy felt like I had beaten the odds of an transparently inequitable college admissions process.
