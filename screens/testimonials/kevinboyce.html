            Historically speaking, higher education has not been highly inaccessible to POC across the country. However, through activities like athletics, students of color have been able to explore academic opportunities that they
            previously would not have even imagined. Brown’s track and field program is responsible for bringing a large percentage of students of color to Brown’s campus and it is unfair to future students of color to eliminate that avenue
            to of access to higher education.
