            If it weren’t for our Track and Field program, I would have transferred from Brown University my freshman year. To be surrounded and compete alongside such a racially, ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse community of
            athletes who contribute astronomically to the quality of my experience at Brown is no small matter. In fact, to me and many other athletes it defines my experience as a college student, so much so that a decision like this will
            lead me to seriously consider whether or not I would like to continue to attend Brown University. I know firsthand the extent to which the track team contributes to the culture of academic, athletic, and personal excellence Brown
            University so desperately wants to foster, and to see one of the best universities in the world make such a damaging decision in such a negligent manner reflects the consistent prioritization of money and appearance over the
            well-being of the students who make Brown University the institution that it is today.
