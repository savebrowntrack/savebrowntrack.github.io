            One of the hardest things to leave is your family, and that is exactly what the men's and women's combined XC and Track & Field program provides. When a student-athlete graduates it is a bittersweet experience because they are
            losing the family they have lived, trained, laughed and cried with day after day for four years. But instead, to have that family torn apart unceremoniously when the student-athletes are not prepared - with no warning and no
            recourse - is utterly hearltess.
