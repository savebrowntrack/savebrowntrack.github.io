            Track has always been a part of who I am and has helped me to become the man I am today. Although it is not the only reason I chose to attend Brown, I truly believe it has been essential in my development to become a better
            person. To see Track get cut is hard because I know the benefits it has for other African-American males looking to use it as a means to achieve a higher education.
