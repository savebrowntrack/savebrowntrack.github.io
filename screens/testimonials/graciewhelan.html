            Being a part of the track team at Brown University has been one of the most impactful experiences I will ever be a part of. This team is a family that cares for each other on and off the track. Whenever someone of this team gets
            knocked down, man or women, both genders surround that person with support and love.
            <br></br>
            I will not give up on this cause until the men's team is reinstated. We are a co-ed team. The only difference between myself (a female 400m runner) and a male 400m runner is that our races start 10 minutes apart on meet day. We
            practice together, lift together, recover together.
            <br></br>
            We are one team, we have one goal: bring back men's track.
