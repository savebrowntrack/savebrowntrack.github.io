            My name is Trinity Gray, and I am a proud member of the Brown University Track & Field and Cross Country family. Like many other alumni, I am both shocked and saddened by President Paxon’s decision to effectively end both men’s programs.
            <br></br>
            Like many alumni, I, too, have been searching for a clear answer for why President Paxson has decided to cancel the most racially and socio-economically diverse teams on campus. Track and field should be held as an example of what’s good
            at Brown, instead of being an example of how money in-sport determines the haves and have nots. Like many alumni, I will do all I can to fight this decision and find a way to allow future generations to be able to experience what it means
            to be a member of the Brown Track and Field family.
