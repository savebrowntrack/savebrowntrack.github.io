            Because of Title IX, I received a swim scholarship to go to a State University. Title IX provided me the chance to compete on a strong Division I team of men and women. In 1981 I was a first-generation college graduate.
            Our family was thrilled that my daughter, Clare Peabody, was afforded the opportunity to attend Brown for both academics and athletics. She thrived and graduated in 2018, competing on the Track and Cross Country team all four
            years.
            <br></br>
            Some forty years later since my experience in collegiate athletics, I’m saddened to see the old skewed arguments being used to dismantle sports programs and blame Title IX. Brown knows better. Stand up and do the right thing.
