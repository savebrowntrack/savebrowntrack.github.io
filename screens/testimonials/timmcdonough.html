            Being a member of the Brown Track and Field team has been a singularly defining experience in my life. I have never been a part of a team that has even come close to producing the profound sense of community I feel as a track
            athlete. As a student athlete I have fully dedicated myself to the pursuit of excellence with my teammates. I have known NCAA All-Americans, national and regional qualifiers, school record holders, Ivy League record holders, and
            so many more people whose contribution to Brown athletics far exceeds what can be displayed on a record board. It is crushing to see my season and my teammates' seasons robbed of us, but it is worse to see the team split in two.
            There is no men’s or women’s track at Brown, there is one immense family training, competing, and fighting together. I call on Brown to consider the human impact of this decision, and to immediately reinstate those programs cut by
            the excellence initiative.
