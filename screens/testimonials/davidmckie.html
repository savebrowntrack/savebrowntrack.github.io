            Cross country and track provided an opportunity for a lower middle class, small town Canadian to join the ranks of the Ivy League. It introduced me to my future wife with whom I have two wonderful children. And as a Scottish born
            Canadian, who grew up without an extended family, the country and track and field programs became that family. Spanning races, nationalities, religions, genders, and socio economic backgrounds, they introduced me to a new
            perspective on the world. They made me feel like I belonged at Brown and gave me the confidence I needed to make the most of the opportunity given to me.
