            Being a member of the Brown track and field team has provided me with a diverse, inclusive, and accepting community that is integral to my experience at Brown. Not only would that tight-knit community be torn apart by eliminating
            the men's program, I believe Brown as a whole would be impacted. The sport of track is an avenue through which low-income and POC students are able to receive an unparalleled education, but without half of our program, Brown's
            "commitment" to diversity will suffer.
