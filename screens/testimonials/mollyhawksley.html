            The throws squad was my family at Brown. I vividly remember returning to campus early from winter break or the spring breaks spent on-campus, and those bonding moments we had as some of the only students on campus are some of my fondest
            memories of Brown!
            <br></br>
            As a female thrower, practicing and training with my male teammates was absolutely critical to my progression as an athlete! It was their courage and support that got me through those Sunday morning lifts. The throws squad is small to
            begin with, but with even more specialization within the group (shotput, hammer, discuss, javelin) peer groups for tactical practice in the ring/cage/on the runway were often just two or three of us with coach. While the intimacy and
            personal attention was awesome, having others there to watch and learn from was instrumental. The fact that current and future female throwers won't have that is alarming and disappointing.
