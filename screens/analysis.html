        <h2>#FALSESTART TO EXCELLENCE</h2>
        <p>25% of 2020 Brown Athletics award winners were on the men’s track team. That’s 25% from a single one of Brown’s thirty-eight varsity teams. Athletically, in the past six years, the members of the men’s team have set 15 school records, 110
            top-10 program marks, and won too many indoor and outdoor individual Ivy League titles to count. They have had multiple second team All-Americans and produced two Olympians in the past 8 years: Evan Weinstock ‘14 and Craig Kinsley ‘12.

        <p>
            In 2019 across the Ivy League, track was approximately 50% non-white. In percentage of black men, track outpaces all sports save for football and basketball.

            Brown does not report racial data on its student athletes, so these diversity statistics are estimates based on Brown's reported team sizes and NCAA data on overall Ivy League demographics for 2019. Numbers may vary by 1-2 people due to
            rounding. Per this model, there were likely more black men on the Brown track team than on the soccer, baseball, lacrosse, swimming, wrestling, fencing, golf, ice hockey, tennis, water polo, rowing, and squash teams combined.

        <p>
            The operating cost per individual athlete stands out as the lowest of any sports. In the 2018-2019 academic year, each basketball player at Brown required 12 times more operating cost investment than a track and field / cross country
            athlete. Brown track and field / cross country athletes incurred less than 40% the median operating costs per sport.

            At the program level, track and field / cross country rank 11th out of 15 sports. The program’s operating costs for 2018-2019 were less than 1/10th those of the football program.
