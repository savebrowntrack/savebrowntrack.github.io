        <h2>#FALSESTART TO EXCELLENCE</h2>
        <p>25% of 2020 Brown Athletics award winners were on the men’s track team. That’s 25% from a single one of Brown’s thirty-eight varsity teams. Athletically, in the past six years, the members of the men’s team have set 15 school records, 110
            top-10 program marks, and won too many indoor and outdoor individual Ivy League titles to count. They have had multiple second team All-Americans and produced two Olympians in the past 8 years: Evan Weinstock ‘14 and Craig Kinsley ‘12.
            <br></br>
            Brown Men’s Track and Field and Cross Country athletes have won more Academic All-Ivy awards since 2009 than anyone else on campus, except for their female teammates.
