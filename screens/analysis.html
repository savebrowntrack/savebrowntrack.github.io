        <h2>#FALSESTART TO EXCELLENCE</h2>
        <p>25% of 2020 Brown Athletics award winners were on the men’s track team. That’s 25% from a single one of Brown’s thirty-eight varsity teams. Athletically, in the past six years, the members of the men’s team have set 15 school records, 110
            top-10 program marks, and won too many indoor and outdoor individual Ivy League titles to count. They have had multiple second team All-Americans and produced two Olympians in the past 8 years: Evan Weinstock ‘14 and Craig Kinsley ‘12.

        <h2>#FALSESTART TO DIVERSITY</h2>
        <p>
            In 2019 across the Ivy League, Men’s Indoor and Outdoor track had the 3rd and 4th highest percentage of black athletes per team (after Basketball and Football). In 2019, the two sports were 16% black and almost 50% non-white, making them
            two of the most racially diverse sports in the Ivy League.
            <br></br>

            Brown does not report racial data on its student athletes, so these diversity statistics are estimates based on Brown's reported team sizes and NCAA data on overall Ivy League demographics for 2019, and numbers may vary by 1-2 people due
            to rounding. Per this method, Men’s Track and Field/Cross Country have the second highest number of black athletes at Brown after football. Getting rid of the men’s track team would likely eliminate about 25% of the black male athletes at
            Brown with no guarantee that other programs will overcome this loss (see caveats above, these are estimates).

        <h2>#FALSESTART TO FINANCIAL EFFICACY</h2>
        <p>
            The operating cost per individual athlete stands out as the lowest of any Varsity sports at Brown. In fact, the Men’s Track and Field and Cross Country programs represent the lowest operating cost per individual athlete across the entire
            Ivy League (for both men's and women's sports). Between Cross Country, Indoor
            Track, and Outdoor track, there are 108 combined roster spots, though there are only 47 unique athletes (conservative estimate). Even if the per-capita cost is calculated using roster spots, the combined teams remain the least expensive
            to
            maintain.

            At the program level, track and field / cross country rank 11th most expensive of 15 sports, with a total operating cost of $306,500. For comparison, the next least expensive Ivy League track program is Dartmouth, which spends $515,800 on
            their track team. In addition, it is unclear just how much money cutting Men’s track will truly save, given that the Women’s team remains: The two teams share the vast majority of their resources (facilities, coaches, etc.), so only a
            portion of the Men’s operating cost may actually be removed.

        <h2>#FALSESTART TO ACCESS</h2>
        <p>
            Among surveyed youth sports, track and field stands out as the least expensive sport to participate in at the pre-college level, based on a 2019 survey by the Aspen Institute andUtah State University. This same survey found that
            low-income
            children are six times more likely to quit sports due to costs compared to their high-income peers. This suggests that track and field, as an extremely cost-accessible sport for youth athletes, can represent a source of socioeconomic
            diversity for athletics at the university level.
